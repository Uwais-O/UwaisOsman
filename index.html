                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p1>Hi! My name is Uwais Osman. I am an enthusiastic and self-driven programmer who is consistently striving to learn more and expand 
                    my skills in the field of Software development and design. I am very passionate about creating new and 
                    innovative ideas as well as solutions to everyday problems through the medium of code. Software development
                    has ushered society towards a better and stronger future, I aim to use my growing knowledge as a means to stand 
                    at the forefront of human advancement and am excited to contribute my ideas and skills to the already diverse pool
                    of intelligent thinkers.
                </p1>
                <h3> My Story </h3>
                <p1>I have always been interested in creating my own programs and bringing my ideas to life for as long as I can remember. After 
                    completing one year of a BSC in Physics at the University of Pretoria, I applied for a transfer to Computer Science to fulfil
                    my goal of becoming a software engineer. However , after getting accepted, I was unable to continue my studies due to finances.
                    Thereafter I decided to invest my savings into pursuing a Software Engineering qualification with Hyperiondev, as I was not ready
                    to give up on my dreams.<br>
        
                    <br>Throughout 2022, I have fostered an even deeper love for the practice of coding. I consistently aim to produce my best and excel
                    in this field. I have learnt many new skills and learnt how to apply my self dilligently. I enjoy solving problems and finding different
                    yet more concise ways to overcome obstacles. I am someone who embraces stressful situations and tend to work well under pressure. I do not give
                    up and am determined to make a career for myself in the fascinating world of technology. 
                    I am motivated by success and made stronger by mistakes.</p1>

                    <h3> Education</h3>
                    <p1> •NSC 2020 - Bachelors Pass with a 73% average and an A+ in English HL<br>
                        <br>•Hyperiondev Software Engineering Certificate 2022</p1>
            
                    <h3> Work Experience </h3>
                    <p1> Retail - BAWAS| 2019(Nov) - 2020(Jan):<br>
                        <br>During my time in the retail sector I was responsible for sales, onloading & offloading 
                        as well as dispatch. I was exposed to a work environment for the first time and excelled
                        at dealing with customers, communicating with staff and creating and issuing invoices for various sales
                        including credit and laybyes. I also generated dispatch documents and assisted with allocation.

                <h3>My Upcoming Android Application</h3>
                <p4>An associate and I have began development on a tution application. My colleague is providing content in the form of
                    videos and notes whereas I am responsible for the overall design and deployment of the application. My responsibilities
                    range from basic UI/UX design, to back end development for navigation options, paywall implementations and basic functionality
                    like video and pdf embedding. I conduct tests and have been making quality of life improvements. Our users will have access
                    to concise yet important educational material produced and presented by our team. We aim to expand vastly in the future and hope 
                    to cover more topics as well as implement support for iOS. </p4>

                    <h3>Python Finance Calculator</h3>
                    <p class = "subtext">Designed and created a program which calculated loans and
                        repayments. The program took a variety of user input such as principle amounts and
                        periods. The calculator also offered a users with a menu to enhance navigation and UX.
                        The finance calculator then returned the appropriate results based on user choice and input.</p>

                    <h3>Python Task Manager</h3>
                    <p class = "subtext">Designed and implemented a task manager to assist with tracking
                        of employees as well as tasks. The program utilized file handling to both store and 
                        present data relating to specific tasks. Factors such as employee names, dates and document numbers
                        were used as search criterias to find relevant tasks and update, change or remove them. File handling
                        acted as a database for the task manager data.</p>
                    <hr/>

                    <h3>Python Chemistry Program</h3>
                    <p class = "subtext">Created a program that dived into the world of chemical engineering. The Python
                        Chemistry program allowed users to select a specific chemical equation and manipulate data with the equation.
                        The program functioned as a calculator which implemented both file handling and many math modules such
                        as numpy and matplot. The user was able to obatin various results from multiple elements and compounds
                        through an easy to use menu. The program served to eliminate the need to physically workout equations or
                        plot graphs from said equations. In essence the calculator did the heavy lifting for the user.</p>

                    <h3>Java Project Management System:</h3>
                    <p class = "subtext">The Java project management system used file handling and OOP to manage 
                        tasks of a fictional construction company. The program allowed for user friendly management of both
                        projects and participants (customers, engineers, architects etc.). The program was able to identify projects based
                        on specific criterias such as overdue or incomplete ones. File handling acted a database for the various projects.</p>
                    <hr/>

                    <h3>Java Project Management System with mySQL Database</h3>
                    <p class = "subtext"> This program is similar to the previous Java project manager, however 
                        it has been greatly improved. This program utilized a mySQL database to record and represent various projects. The database
                        implementation allowed for a more robust management and filtration of projects and participants.</p>
